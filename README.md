# reflection-api-java-example

This is a Demo java Class in which i have written a code for accessing any private fields or methods from outside
the java class using java Reflection Api.
Reflection Api provides various tools for inspecting any java object. 
Using these stuffs one can violate the singleTon design pattern or the concept of private keyword in java.

Feel free to ask any question
